![Home-Page](readme-files/home-page.gif)

- I wanted a simple homepage with a Halloween vibe, so I added the spooky font. 

- I used red to create a blood-like effect, and I used bats animation to give the page some movement. 

- I added a play button to allow users to jump right into the quiz, and I believe the homepage is simple to use.

- Plugin to display the bats animation was taken from [jQueryscript](https://www.jqueryscript.net/animation/halloween-bats-flying-around.html)

- As one of my favorite holidays, I decided to create a Halloween quiz. It is the only dark holiday of the year. It's a lot of fun to dress up and enjoy other people's outfits. 

- Decorating your home space, or yard is enjoyable. Everything is done for laughs. 

- This quiz is simply a fun extra activity to do with friends or family during Halloween. 

- In the future, I intend to increase the total number of questions.
