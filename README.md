- I wanted a simple homepage with a Halloween vibe, so I added the spooky font. 

- I used red to create a blood-like effect, and I used bats animation to give the page some movement.

# Design

- To achieve a Halloween vibe, I chose a spooky font. I used dark colors to tie the quiz into the Halloween theme, with red accents to represent blood.

## Why did I choose to do a Halloween Quiz?

- As one of my favorite holidays, I decided to create a Halloween quiz. It is the only dark holiday of the year. It's a lot of fun to dress up and enjoy other people's outfits. Decorating your home, or yard is enjoyable. Everything is done for fun. 

- This quiz is simply a fun extra activity to do with friends or family during Halloween.

## Color Scheme
For the project, these colors were chosen :

- `linear-gradient(to bottom, #051937, #171228, #190a1a, #12040d, #000000)` <sup>background on all pages</sup>

- ‚ö´Ô∏è <sup>black</sup>
- ‚ö™Ô∏è <sup>white</sup>
- üî¥ <sup>red</sup>
- üü¢ <sup>green</sup>

# Bugs

While working on this quiz project, I found some bugs. The bug consists primarily of mobile and tablet devices.

<p align="center">
 <img src="readme-files/quiz-bug.gif">
</p>

- The hover effect on the answer box does not return to its initial position after submission. 
- The only way to prevent this is to select the actual letter choice and after select the answer.
- Additionally, the letters A, B, C, D, are shuffled in the wrong order.

## How did I solve this problem?

- I haven't yet come up with a solution to these bugs.
